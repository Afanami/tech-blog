## Project Vision

To create a functioning blog using technology I've been using recently such as Next.js, GraphQL and tailwindcss. Long term I want to use this blog to post about new things I learn to help me understand what I'm learning better by giving myself the ability to write it out and teach others.

## Project Progress

Setup Next.js template and updated README file with project information. Created most of the major components and required for the page and structured out document. Created some GraphQL queries to start fetching some data from Hygraph. Implemented Header and Posts components as well as the PostWidget.
